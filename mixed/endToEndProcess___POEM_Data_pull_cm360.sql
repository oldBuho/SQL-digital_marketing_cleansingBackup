1Â° be sure template table "poem_data_pull_dis_and_vid" is truncated 
and your source table has the same fields as this template table. 

note: imp and clicks are treated as varchar for later comma extraction in case the data
is rendered as "1,200" so it would be converted to a simple number "1200".

BEFORE UPLOAD delete first lines containing report data (date range, source, etc)
and also delete final empty rows
